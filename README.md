<h1>IoT-setup and configuration</h1>

 ### [For packet tracer](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consist of a simple setup of an IoT environment in a manufacturing industry. The goal of this project was to enable employee to have remote access to the manufacturing operation. With Packet Tracer I have set up wireless access point and connected  the server plus IoT devices. The Water drain IoT devices is responsible for draining water out of the tank. The Trip Sensor and the Siren works together to inform employee of any failure in the production system. Temperature monitor and Thermostat are used to monitor and adjust temperature for the production system.
